                    The game, which finished 3-2 to Toulouse, was plunged into confusion as the on-field 
                     referee, Georgi Kabakov, appeared to initially give the goal, before reversing his
                     decision and going to check the replay monitors at the side of the pitch. 
                     After reviewing the footage, he ruled the goal out, judging that Liverpool’s 
                     Alexis Mac Allister handled the ball 14 seconds before the goal went in. The decision 
                     sent Stadium TFC into a frenzy, leaving Le Téfécé celebrating a famous win and Liverpool 
                     players incensed. “We scored a third goal, I think it’s a goal, 100%. I’m not even sure the 
                     ball touches the hand at all, but that’s how it is,” Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told 
                     TNT Sports after the match. Match footage shows that the ball came off Mac Allister’s 
                     chest and onto his arm as he tried to control a clearance. Liverpool then started another 
                     attack, with Toulouse unable to clear the ball on a number of occasions before Quansah’s 
                     shot found the back of the net.

                    Plastic pollution continues to be a key sustainability challenge for the world. 
                    Our latest report investigates different aspects of plastic pollution to share our 
                    research and allow for better understanding of this complicated issue, where taking 
                    action is often not as straightforward as it seems. Where are we now? There is no 
                    revelation in the notion that plastic is all around us. The global economy has become 
                    heavily plastic reliant, which can be seen in the numbers that are showcased in our 
                    report. To illustrate the current situation and try to make predictions for the future
                    we developed a measurement – the Plastic Kaya Identity – which involves human
                    population and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. This measurement also
                    introduces plastic usage intensity of GDP, which refers to the amount of plastic
                    used in relation to GDP, and is a figure that is increasing.
                    Between 1960 and 2020 it rose by almost 5,000%. At the same time, real GDP grew by 
                    approximately 650% and the population more than doubled, increasing by 
                    approximately 160%. What does this mean?. For every dollar of GDP added to 
                    global economy, the data suggests that more and more plastic was required 
                    to make it happen.

                    while North American companies make up just 15% in terms of the number of constituents,
